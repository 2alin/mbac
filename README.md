## A bit more about the project
MBac comprises software tools and an optional low-cost hardware setup for bacterial motility determination. The analysis is picture based and can either be used for end point determination or for monitoring bacteria swarming on agar plates. The software can determine various parameters like shape migration speed, migration direction or shape formation which usually are hard to determine in common motility assays. An optional lighting chamber can be 3D printed and equipped with single-board computer and a camera to perform on-line motility measurements and analysis.  


Explain what makes your project special, useful, exciting! You can use the ideas you generated for “Unique Value Proposition” in your Open Canvas here.

Show how to get started using or contributing to the project. If you’re just getting started, this could be as simple as asking people to attend a planning call or kick-off event, or sign up for an email newsletter about the project. If you’re not sure quite how to get users involved just yet, don’t worry! In the next module, you’ll devise some ways for newcomers to get involved, and create contributor guidelines. Once you’ve done the next module, and you can come back to this README and add a link to contributor guidelines to this section.

State what resources are most needed. If you have a need for a special kind of help, expertise, or a resource like event space, be sure to mention that here.
