## Hello!
Welcome to the MBac project repository! I started it as part of Mozilla Open Leaders Round 5 in early 2018. Here we work on the development of software tools and a low-cost open hardware setup to study how bacteria move. If you are interested you can read a bit more about the idea behind MBac and who I am in this README.

## What are your bacteria doing when you are not looking?

I am working with bacteria and some time ago I started to perform experiments to see how well my favorite bacteria can move. For this I usually put some of the bacteria in the middle of an agar plate in the evening, kept them at their favorite temperature for the night and was greeted in the morning with shapes like you can see on the right.

Pretty amazing, right? Sometimes they reminded me of [fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) but they can also be very plain. I was instantly curious about what the bacteria are doing in the night when I am not watching and how these shapes form.


## Why would somebody be interested in bacteria movements?
Almost all bacteria can perform some kind of active movement. This means they can travel distances with their own power without being transported by wind or water. The ability to move is very crucial because it makes a lot of things easier and faster. For example bacteria can follow traces of small molecules which lead them to their food (this is called [chemotaxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis)). You can imagine this like the smell of a freshly brewed coffee which you follow to find its source (the cup of coffee you might be craving for). And like you the bacteria rely on active movement to reach favourite food! Another advantage is the resulting ability to move to different places to check out how living is there. This enables the bacteria start new communities and discover food sources. They can also move together as a group like a swarm of fish in the sea or birds in the sky (that's why this ability is called [swarming motility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarming_motility)).

While all this very useful for the bacteria it often causes problems when we try to fight harmful bacteria species. For example some species can quickly form community layer ([biofilm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofilm)) on medical instruments which are hard to remove because the bacteria provide each other stability and protection. That's why the ability to move and spread faster sometimes makes a bacterium more dangerous  than others. This is one reason why many scientists are studying bacteria movements and how they are made possible. In my PhD project I am looking at molecular surface structures of bacteria and how they influence the way bacteria move and colonize plants

## Let me present to you: The Problem

## How can you contribute?
For a more detailed description about how you can contribute check out [CONTRIBUTING.md]().


Since this project is part of Mozilla Open Leaders Round 5 (and because they are well elaborated) the Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines apply to everyone who wants to contribute to this project.

## And why should you contribute?

## Who is behind all this?
I am a PhD student at the Technical University of Munich, combining microbiology, plant sciences and biochemistry in my research. I love 3D printing, recreating scientific instruments and getting lost on unnecessary nerdy projects. MBac started as one of such nerdy projects but turned into something unexpectedly useful. If you want to know about other things I do and have done so far you can visit [openplant.science](openplant.science) or follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/alexwastooshort).
